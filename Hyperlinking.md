The terminal plug-in recognizes and provides hyperlinks for URLs using the HTTP(S) protocol.

Hyperlinks are displayed in italics. Hovering a mouse over a hyperlink changes the cursor to the "hand" cursor. Clicking on a hyperlink will open its URL in the browser that has been chosen in Eclipse's "Browser" Preferences.

For a future release, we'd like to provide:
  * Hyperlinking in Java stack traces
  * Hyperlinking to files in a Eclipse workspace
  * An extension point for custom hyperlink factories
