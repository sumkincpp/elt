### 08/05/2012 - 1.1.0 released ###
In this version we did a major cleanup of the forked code. It includes: package renaming, removal of unnecessary code, removal of code duplication, code formatting and more.

Since the name of the plug-in feature changed, it is better to uninstall 1.0.0, instead of updating the plug-in.

Bugs fixed:
  * [Issue 14](https://code.google.com/p/elt/issues/detail?id=14): Option to disable blinking cursor
  * [Issue 17](https://code.google.com/p/elt/issues/detail?id=17): "Open terminal here" not available in Navigator view
  * [Issue 25](https://code.google.com/p/elt/issues/detail?id=25): Terminal Plugin displays bold+black as white color
  * [Issue 26](https://code.google.com/p/elt/issues/detail?id=26): Terminal emulator does not honor the encoding of the terminal connector
