This idea is borrowed from the Windows XP Power Toy "Command Prompt Here." The idea is that a terminal can be opened
from the context menu of any file or folder. The terminal will use as working directory:

  * the parent folder of the selected file, or
  * the selected folder

### "New Local Terminal" button ###

Terminal views have a button "New Terminal" that allows you to open as many terminals as you wish.
